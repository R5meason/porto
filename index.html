            The road to becoming a junior developer has not always easy, in fact, it's been quite a challenge. After a
            long stint of working in call centers and customer service, I reevaluated what's really important to me, and
            decided to go back to school. With the knowledge and experience I've gained gained by designing games, to
            developing apps, I have turned a simple hobby into a career in a field I thoroughly enjoy.
